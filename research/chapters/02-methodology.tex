% Research Design 
\section{Research Design}
The research design used in this study is \emph{exploratory research}.


This design is usually used in Machine Learning researches. 

\section{Locale and Population of the Study}
The study is conducted at the comfort of the researcher's residence. 


\section{Data Gathering Instrument}
Data is the most important part of any type of Machine Learning Research. 
Since this research focuses on the feasibility of using a trained 
Convolutional Neural Network embedded in Smartphone Application to diagnose 
various plant diseases from an image of plant leaves, a plethora of 
healthy and infected plant leaf images were required to conduct this study. 

The researcher is in debt for the following datasets which were made publicly 
available. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Plant Village Dataset}  \\ 
        - The PlantVillage dataset consists of $54303$ healthy and unhealthy leaf 
         images divided into $38$ categories by species and disease.

            \caption{Example of images in the Plant Village Dataset}
         \end{figure}


    \item \textbf{Citrus Dataset} \\ 
        - The dataset contains $759$ images of healthy and unhealthy images for both Citrus fruits and
         leaves collectively. Each image contains $256 \times 256$ dimensions with $72$ dpi resolution.  \\ 

         \begin{figure}[h!]

         \end{figure}

    % ! Temporary
    % \item \textbf{Field Images of Maize Annotated with Disease Symptoms} \\
    %     - This dataset consists of $18,222$ images annotated with 
    %     $105,705$ Northern Leaf Blight lesions.
